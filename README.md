This is a basic text-based chatbot built with Python. It uses Natural Language Processing techniques to understand user inputs and respond accordingly based on predefined intents.

- Uses **scikit-learn**'s Naive Bayes classifier for intent classification
- Processes user input with **CountVectorizer** for text vectorization
- Supports multiple intents such as greetings, goodbyes, thanks, study tips, and more
- Easy to extend by adding new intents in the `intents.json` file
- Simple command-line interface for chatting
